# Integration of Hyperspectral Imagery and Spaceborne LiDAR Data for Updated Mapping of the Ecosystems in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor
*Last updated: 20.01.2026*

## Project overview
In line with the adage that "you can't manage what you can't measure," ecosystem maps are crucial tools for conservation. Toward that, in 1999 - twenty five years before the launch of NASA's [PACE observatory](https://pace.oceansciences.org/home.htm) - the World Bank and the Government of the Netherlands funded a critical effort to map the terrestrial ecosystems of Central America, long recognized as one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, but which had also been affected by widespread deforestation in the 1970s and the 1980s. By 2002, regional scientists had completed a [map](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/504821468016811336/pdf/352550rev.pdf) - based on visual interpretation of Landsat Thematic Mapper data (from NASA and the USGS) - which recognized almost 200 individual ecosystem types. In the almost quarter century since the publication of that effort ([*Vreugdenhil et al. 2002*](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/504821468016811336/pdf/352550rev.pdf)), while access to spaceborne Earth observation data has grown exponentially, the Central American ecosystem mapping data have not been updated.

Given the launch of the PACE observatory in early 2024 and its unique hyperspectral imaging capabilities, we propose to utilize data from PACE's [Ocean Color Instrument (OCI)](https://pace.oceansciences.org/oci.htm) to generate an updated version of a regional ecosystem map of Central America, also leveraging vegetation structural data from NASA’s [Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI)](https://gedi.umd.edu) mission. Due to the large data volumes that will have to be managed, and given the PI’s status as a [Google Developer Expert](https://g.dev/bzgeo), the cloud-based [Google Earth Engine (GEE)](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) platform will be leveraged for this research effort. A dedicated open repository for processing PACE OCI data for terrestrial applications will be one of the outputs of this effort. This will also complement work that the PI and the co-I have done in the context of the Ecosystem & Carbon Management thematic area of the [former] SERVIR program.
